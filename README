==================================
The Rolling Hough Transform (RHT)
==================================

This is the Rolling Hough Transform, described in Clark, Peek, & Putman 2014, ApJ 789, 82 (arXiv:1312.1338).

Included is a modified RHT which distinguishes between pixels located at theta, and at theta+pi, in polar coordinates centered on any given image pixel. This is achieved by searching along radii with twice the dtheta of the diameters searched in the RHT. This Transform is still in development.

==================================
Requirements (Python 2.7 Only)
==================================
from __future__ import division #Must be first line of code in the file
from astropy.io import fits
import scipy.ndimage
import math
import os
import sys
import string
import tempfile 
import shutil
import time 
import fnmatch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

==================================
Instructions For Use (Python)
==================================
1. Ensure your Python 2.7 Environment is as up-to-date as possible and contains the required imports. The code has been tested to run on both Windows and Mac computers successfully, without modification:

>>>python --version //Currently Supports 2.7.5

2. Ensure you are able to import the package:

>>>import rht 

3. Run the RHT for individual files or directories, given a number of parameters. Output will be placed alongside the input files in the .fits format, with a record of the parametrs that created it:

>>>rht.main() #Runs the RHT, after asking for user input, with default parameters

>>>rht.main('filepath') #Runs the RHT for a given image or within a given directory with default parameters

>>>rht.main('filepath', flag=value, param=value) #Runs with some flag set to a boolean and some param set to a number

4. Explanation of rht.main() Flags and Parameters
   Flags: 
     force=False  # If True, forcefully overwrites existing RHT data with same parameter values.
     drht=False   # If True, runs the directional RHT, which returns output on a full, rather than half, polar domain.
     
   Params:
     wlen=55.0  # Set window diameter in pixels.
     smr=11.0   # Set smoothing radius in pixels. 
     frac=0.70  # Set theta power threshold. 

5. Displaying the results of previously Interpreted RHT data (#TODO_Deprecated)

>>>rht.viewer('filepath') #Will first call rht.interpret('filepath') if necessary
>>>rht.viewer('filepath', force=True) #Will ALWAYS call rht.interpret('filepath', force=True) first

==================================
Instructions For Use (Terminal)
==================================
Command Line Argument Format:
 >>>python rht.py arg1 arg2 ... argn 

NO ARGS:
 Displays README and exits
 >>>python rht.py

SINGLE ARGS:
 pathname ==> Input file or directory to run the Default RHT on
 >>>python rht.py dirname/filename.fits
  
 'help', '-help', 'h', '-h' ==> Displays this message
 >>>python rht.py -h
 
MULTIPLE ARGS:
 1st ==> Input file or directory to run the RHT on
 2nd:nth ==> Named inputs controlling parameters and flags
  Flags: 
  '-f', '--force'         ==> Force overwrite RHT output run with same parameters.
  '-d', '--drht'          ==> Compute Directional RHT (full polar domain).
  
  Params:
  '-w', '--wlen' =value   ==> Sets window diameter
  '-s', '--smr' =value    ==> Sets smoothing radius
  '-t', '--thresh' =value ==> Sets theta power threshold
